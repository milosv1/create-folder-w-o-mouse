# create-folder-w-o-mouse
Simple script to create a folder without need of mouse.
As of 27/06/2020 we have the combination keys working, meaning a listener is activated on tab + n, untill the user presses esc then it will stop.
Implemented folder creation, take note that once the key combo is activated you will need to create a folder to be able to exit the program. 28/06/2020
